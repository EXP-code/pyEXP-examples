The file names in the list are assumed to end with a snapshot index and an optional part index.  For example, if you have single files per snapshot, the list might look like: `myrun.00000`, `myrun.00001`, etc.  If you have multiple files per snapshot, they will look something like `myrun.00000_0001`, `myrun.00000_0002`, `myrun.00001_0000`, `myrun.00001_0001`, etc.\n",
