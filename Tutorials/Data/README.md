# Sample data from the `Nbody` example

We provide a bit of sample output from the example in the directory above for
use with pyEXP tutorials and for general code testing.

## File description

- The files `OUT.run0.00xxx` are phase-space snapshots in HDF5 format.
- The `outcoef*` files are the coefficients from the basis function
  expansions, also in HDF5 format
- The `ORBTRACE.run0` file contains the orbital trajectories for the specified
  sample of five orbits specified in the `../config.yml` file
- The `OUTLOG.run0` file describes the global properties of the phase space in
  time for the entire ensemble and for each phase-space component
- The files, `config.cube.yml` and `outcoef.cube.run0`, are the
  configuration and coefficients files, respectively, for a Cube simulation
