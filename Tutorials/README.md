# pyEXP-examples/Tutorials

Scripts and notebooks that illustrate the features of pyEXP

New to pyEXP? Start with the two-part tutorial in the Introduction.

## Launching Jupyter for the tutorials

Start Jupyter in the `Tutorials` directory and then navigate to
subdirectories to run individual notebooks. If you are using the
Docker image, start your `expbox` script using the `-d
/path/to/pyEXP-examples/Tutorials` flag.

The `Tutorials` directory provides all the necessary data in the
`Data` subdirectory.  We recommend beginning with the `Introduction`
subdirectory for the best experience.
