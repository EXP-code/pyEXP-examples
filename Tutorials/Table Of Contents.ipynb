    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are designed to give you enough scaffolding and understanding of `pyEXP` concepts that you can apply the key ideas to your own projects.\n",

    "## Where do I start?\n",
    "\n",
    "The TOC below gives you a list of all the tutorial notebooks with an order that progressively builds on previous idioms from prior notebooks.  Each notebook will link you the next, previous, and this page for convenience.\n",
