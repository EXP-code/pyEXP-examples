# pyEXP-examples/How-To

Cookbook examples from the EXP developers and user-contributed research tools.

## Organization

| Directory    | Contents |
| ---          | ---      |
| Recipes      | Example workflows using pyEXP |
| Utilities    | Using pyEXP in scripts for post-processing BFE coefficients.  See the README in 'Utilities' for contents. |

`Utilities` is a directory maintained by the EXP developers with examples of particular `pyEXP` capabilities.
We envision the `Recipes` directory as user-contributed fragments of code to perform specific research tasks.
