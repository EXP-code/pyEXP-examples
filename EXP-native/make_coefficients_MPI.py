# This script makes an HDF5 coefficient set from some Gadget files in
# parallel using MPI.  This can easily be adapted for whatever
# snapshots you have and could be run on a cluster
#

# There is a companion Jupyter Notebook called 'test_read_gadget.ipynb'
# that reads in the coefficients made by this script to check that
# they seem sane.

# Usage:
#
# Run command is: "mpirun -np N python3 make_coefficients_MPI.py"
# where N is the number of processes.  For Slurm allocations, you can
# leave off "-np N" as usual.
